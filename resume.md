Experience
----------

2013-Present
: **Machine Learning Engineer, Inria Parietal**

I help improve and maintain the [scikit-learn] project (a reference
machine learning library for Python) by implementing new
methods and optimizing existing code. I review code submitted as pull
requests on github, maintain the Continuous Integration infrastructure
and make releases.

I also mentor interns and PhD students of the team and at *Center for
Data Science, Université Paris-Saclay*. I teach workshops on Machine
Learning with scikit-learn at various international conferences.

2017-Present
: **Deep Learning lecturer, Université Paris Saclay**

I teach a [course on Deep Learning] in collaboration with Charles
Ollion to 90 students of the *Master in Data Science* degree.

The lectures introduce various neural networks architectures (feed
forward, recurrent, sequence to sequence, attentional mechanisms),
stochastic optimization, applications to recommender systems, images
classification, object detection, image segmentation, text
classification and machine translation. We also gave an overview of
current understanding of expressivity and generalization capabilities of
neural networks.

Practical applications are taught with Keras and TensorFlow with GPU
machines running on a public cloud.

2018-Present
: **Text Mining lecturer, INP-HB, Yamoussoukro**

I teach a practical [course on Text Mining] with Python to final year
students of the *Master in Data Science* degree in a partnership between
INP-HB and Ecole Polytechnique.

2004-2013
: **Software Engineer, Nuxeo**

I contributed to the development of the Nuxeo Enterprise Content
Management platform in general and helped customers build content
applications on top of the platform (Java and Python) and run them in
production.

I was also in charge of the R&D effort on semantic knowledge extraction
from unstructured data and the design and development of Nuxeo Drive, a
dropbox-like desktop folder synchronization utility for the Nuxeo
platform.

Technical Experience
--------------------

**Python, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Cython, numba:** very good knowledge and
active contributor to the PyData ecosystem in general.

**Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch:** good knowledge of GPU-enabled
deep learning frameworks based on reverse-mode automatic differention.

**Parallel and Distributed Computing and Data Analytics:** practical
experience with OpenMP, Joblib (developer), Dask, Spark and Hadoop. Good
knowledge of the computational tradeoffs of linear algebra routines
(OpenBLAS, CuBLAS) and hardware constraints (multi-core CPU, GPU, memory
bandwidth and data transfer). System programming with threads and
processes.

**Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Amazon AWS:** practical
experience in setting up compute clusters for data analytics and GPU
computing.

**Docker, Kubernetes:** container-based automation for continuous
 integration, development and cluster computing.

**Public Speaking Experience**

I gave numerous presentations on Python for machine learning, cloud
computing, scientific programming and deep learning at conferences
and meetups (PyCon, Scipy, EuroScipy, PyData...)

**Scientific Review**

I participate in the review process of the *Journal of Machine Learning
Research*, in particular on the software track.

**Consulting**

I did a bit of consulting on machine learning, data analytics and deep
learning for startups and a large tech company in Redmond.

**Languages**

French (native speaker) and English (fluent)

**Media**

 I explained some algorithmic data analytics concepts on the French
    radio: [France Inter in 2016] and [France Inter in 2017]
